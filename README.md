##CTC Coding Challenge

  ## Description
  This is a basic application made with laravel for the back end and inertia for the front end views.  It is capable of registering a user, logging that user in and then logging them out.   

  This app was designed to demonstrate my familiarity with building a fullstack app capable of achieving basic authentication functions of any modern application
